# microsoft-teams-step-send-message

The Microsoft Teams step container sends a message to a Microsoft Teams channel.

## Configuration

In order to create an incoming webhook URL you will need to follow the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook). The channel and username of the message are chosen as part of the webhook configuration and are not configurable in the Relay integration itself.
